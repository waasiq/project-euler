### Project Euler Solutions

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. This repository contains the solutions to the problems I have solved in various programming languages.
Project Euler consists of tricky problems which can be solved using with help of mathematics. It not only helps you to improve your programming knowledge but also helps you broaden your mathematical knowledge.

### Reasons for sharing these solutions

I strive to:

- Explain my choice of algorithms and data structures.

- Explain the mathematics I have used in order to solve a problem.
- Improve my programming skill by using various programming languages. (As of now the solutions are mostly in C++ but I will add solutions in other languages as well).


### Project Euler Solutions musn't be published

The website itself discourages the sharing of solutions. I however have a slightly different point of view: 
- A lot of my knowledge is based on things I was taught, I saw somewhere or I stumbled across. If someone is stuck on some problem after trying for several days it is no shame to ask for help.


If someone visits this repository then the person has already realized that he/she can't solve that problem and is doing the right thing: ask someone. That's the only way how knowledge can be spread - all famous scientists wrote books.

Copying the solution doesn't yield anything because that would not be learning at all. Looking at the code and analyzing step by step how the problem is solved in order to learn and improve oneself would provide beneficial. 

I have given some basic hints in order to solve the problems although I will keep improving the hints and add various techniques to solve the problem one can always try to solve the problems with help of these techniques.
